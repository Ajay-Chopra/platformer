1. Player animations
    a. Complete the sword throw animation
        Sword throwing rules
            - if player throws sword, they lose the sword
            - if the sword hits a piece of terrain it will stick into the terrain
            and the player can retrieve it
    b. add the hit/death animation
    c. Fix the air attack bug (figure out some kind of system to keep track of player attacks)
