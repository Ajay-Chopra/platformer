Game is pretty much entirely working. Things still to do:
    a. add character attacks to gameplay
        - Need default key bindings
        - Space: Jump
        - Arrows: Left/Right
        - ZXC for attacks
        - Press same keys while in the air for air attacks
        - L shift for throwing sword
