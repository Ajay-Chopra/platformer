Game is pretty much entirely working. Things still to do:
    a. import new character animations
        i. see if I can use the aseprite files to make the sprites bigger
        ii. Need to go to aseprite and make all of the sprites 130 x 130 (Done)
        iii. Export all the PNGs and crop them (ugh)
    b. Need to put everything in here into a git repo
